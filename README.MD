# Two-layered Vectorial Kernel Models for Detailed Surface Kinetics using a Goal-Oriented Approach

## Watch a Kernel model train

Fitting MATLAB's *peaks()* function with a gaussian Kernel Model.
The model is greedy, i.e. it iteratively chooses the points where the difference to the reference function is highest and adds a new gaussian function there.
All those Gauss functions have the same width.
